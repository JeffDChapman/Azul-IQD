# Azul-IQD
 Azul Intelligent Query Designer

This C# software behaves like a Wizard to build SQL queries when you check on boxes to specify Tables, Joins, and output fields. It was initially designed to work with Azure SQLdb standalone databases. Version 1.3 also supports old MS Access (.mdb) databases and MS SQL Server.
